        <p>
            This website aims to answer the following questions.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Which countries have <b>consistently low unemployment rate</b>?</li>
            <li><b>Where</b> are they from?</li>
            <li>What are their <b>level of development</b>?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Our team hypothesizes that <b>countries with a high level of development</b> and <b>Western countries (North America and Europe)</b> would have lower rates compared to the rest of the world.

                    Here is a more detailed distribution of the countries with low average unemployment rate based on region and income group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The World Bank uses "Income Groups" to show the level of development of a country.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Restating our hypothesis, <b>Western countries</b> such as North American countries and European countries are commonly seen as <b>highly developed</b> which might have safeguards against joblessness.
             
        </p> 
            <p>But based on the data explored so far, it is <b>not true</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <b>High income countries</b> which represents highly developed countries scored <b>second</b> while <b>lower middle income countries had the lowest unemployment rate in general</b>. 
            <b>Sub-Saharan Africa tops the charts</b> with <b>Europe and Central Asia third</b> and North America is not seen here.
            Only Austria, Iceland, Kyrgyz Republic, Luxembourg, Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland from Europe had low rates.
        </p>  
        <p>
            More research must be done to better understand why this is the case. Some suggestions are to see the relationship of regions and income groups regarding unemployment rate and to consider other factors that may affect unemployment rate such as demographics, economic performance and implemented strategies of countries.
